## Info
App is buil in React JS 
Clone the repo and use `npm start` to run on your local machine
If you are cloning this repo make sure to use your own firebase configuration of web keys , as one used in this project has been depleted 
## Required Fixes
There are still some changes needs to be done like first two steps for pawn , castling etc.
Selected piece needs to change color to show some sign of responsiveness.
Martyr list is not working.
And validate the movement of both players such that player can make move respect to their turns as I have first build this project on Local level so logic for such validation is still left!
